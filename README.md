# Pygame Platformer with AI Bug Detection System

A sophisticated 2D platformer game built with Pygame, featuring an advanced AI player and automated bug detection system. The project implements real-time monitoring and reporting of gameplay anomalies through an elegant HTML-based reporting system.

> This project builds upon and enhances the original [Pygame-Platformer by BoboStyx](https://github.com/BoboStyx/Pygame-Platformer) by adding advanced AI capabilities and automated bug detection features.

The Project with path finding ai without bugs is https://github.com/purushottamnar/AI-GAME-TEST-BOT/Pygame-Platformer-main.zip

## üéÆ Features

### AI Player System
- Intelligent enemy targeting and combat
- Advanced movement with double-jump capabilities
- Obstacle detection and avoidance
- Platform detection and navigation
- Projectile dodging system

### üêõ Bug Detection System
The system monitors and detects four types of gameplay anomalies:

1. **Combat Bugs** (üó°Ô∏è)
   - Detects combat inaction when enemies are in range
   - Monitors attack opportunities and engagement
   - Threshold: 4 seconds without attacking when enemies are within 100px

2. **Immortal Fall Bugs** (üíÄ)
   - Tracks continuous falling without platforms
   - Monitors excessive jump attempts
   - Triggers after 15 seconds without platform detection
   - Scans 200px below player for platforms

3. **Decision Making Bugs** (ü§î)
   - Monitors AI decision consistency
   - Detects rapid target switching
   - Triggers on more than 3 switches within 1 second

4. **Bullet Survival Bugs** (üéØ)
   - Tracks bullet hit survival
   - Monitors damage threshold violations
   - Triggers after surviving 3+ hits

### üìä Automated Bug Reporting
- Real-time HTML report generation
- Session-based bug tracking
- Persistent bug history
- Visual metrics and analytics
- Color-coded bug categorization

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Pygame-Platformer.git
cd Pygame-Platformer
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

3. Run the game:
```bash
python Hpgame.py
```

### Controls
- **TAB**: Enable/Disable AI Player
- **Arrow Keys**: Manual Movement
- **SPACE**: Jump
- **Z**: Attack

## üìà Bug Reports

Bug reports are automatically generated in the `Logs` directory as `gameplay_bug_history.html`. Each report includes:
- Session information
- Bug type and occurrence time
- Detailed metrics and analysis
- Visual representation of bug data

### Report Features
- **Session Tracking**: Each gameplay session is uniquely identified
- **Bug Categories**: Color-coded for easy identification
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time statistics and counters
- **Persistent History**: Maintains record across multiple sessions

## üîß Technical Details

This is my 2d platformer using pygame to do such, credit to [Donal Salin](https://github.com/DonalSa) for help with the sprites, animation, sfx, and music.
The objective of the game is to eliminate all the enemies on the current level to load to the next level. There are a total of 3 levels.
You can choose between two characters.

Okarin:

or Bobo:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57f6bbd4-9328-47a3-aa8f-2274135e053c)

Okarin has three jumps, while Bobo has two dashes.
The controls are W,A,S,D for movement, you can also use the arrow keys if you would like. X or Left Shift for dash.  W and Up Arrow Key are for jump.
The enemies shoot via guns and the player must dodge these projectiles and dash into the enemies to eliminate them.
If the player gets shot they restart the current level from the start with all the enemies reloaded in.
The player will also have to reload in if they are freefalling for too long, so navigate wisely!
Wall jumps use up the players jumps as well i.e. if playing Okarin and you jump onto a wall using one jump, jumping of the wall consumes a jump meaning you only have one jump left in the air.

Here is what should load when you run the game. (Depends on your character)

To run this game go into the file Hpgame.py and run it. Pygame and python3 should be installed to run this game.
